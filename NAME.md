# Name
Just an explanation on the weird name of the library.
Usually I like to give very simple and direct name to my libraries.
For this one I was thinking to call it just Flags, but already exists
FunWithFlags and it wouldn't be cool to have a library with a similar name that
works on the same domain. Then [jolly roger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolly_Roger)
crossed my mind as a cool name. That's where the pirate theming come up.

So on the pirate theme two musics came to my mind:

[![S.H.A.P.T.-Piratas do metal](https://img.youtube.com/vi/PUVFG6KASK8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUVFG6KASK8)

SHAPT is a brazilian comedy metal band and the music name directly translates to
"Pirates of Metal".

The music in the readme is a reference to this:
